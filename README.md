Snake clone written in Z80 assembly for the ZX Spectrum

## Why? There are already thousands of Snake clones. Why do we need another one?
Mainly as a programming exercise, as I had always programmed using high-level languages, and for a long time I have wanted to try my hand at something lower-level (e.g. C or assembly). I also wanted to produce some well-documented code that may help others who are having a go at learning assembly. I picked Snake as it was quite a simple game, and I didn't want to overwhelm myself with anything too complicated. If anything came out the other side that was remotely playable, then this was more of a bonus. Currently, the game isn't quite complete; however it's at the very least playable.

If anyone would like to help me polish the game (even if only the graphics), please contact me. Any help with the game would be greatly appreciated.

## How to play
You will need to download [znake.tap](znake.tap) and you will need an emulator, e.g. [Speccy](http://fms.komkon.org/Speccy/). The Kempston joystick interface must be enabled, as keyboard controls are not currently supported.

## Assemble
Znake was assembled using Pasmo:
`pasmo --name znake --tapbas znake.z8a znake.tap`
